/**
 * The n-Queen problem:
 *
 *  n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an nÃ—n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all
 *  natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3
 *
 *  This is the epitome of a recursive back tracking problem. Any recursive function has to have the following
 *  properties
 *      1) base case, a.k.a the terminating condition
 *      2) each recursion breaks the problem into smaller chunks
 *      3) results from each recursion should be used to make decisions further up the chain

    /**
     * Approach:
     *  For each location on the board place 1st queen, mark that location with 1, recurse with the 2nd queen
     *  by leveling up.
     *  Using helper function to determine if location is in column, row or diagonal (upper left, upper right, lower
     *  left, lower right) path of any of the queens (1s) already on the board.
     *  Find location suitable for 2nd queen, mark that location with 1 and recurse with the third queen and repeat
     *  process as with the second queen
     *  If a suitable spot is not found, return false and backtrack to the second queen and find next suitable spot
     *  for the 2nd queen before attempting to place the 3rd queen.

     * with respect to the cell being tested for. Example

     *  rows = (0 - N-1, 2) can be attacked

     *  minor diagonal cells (3, 0), (2, 1) and (0, 3) can be attacked
     *
     *  By observing the diagonal cells, we can derive a pattern to check if it falls along a cell's diagonal path
     *  For major diagonal all cells conform to (y-x) = (2-1) = 1
