/**
 * Given a string, print the longest repeating subseequence such that the two subsequence don’t have same string
 * character at same position, i.e., any i’th character in the two subsequences shouldn’t have the same index in
 * the original string.
 *
 * Input: str = "aabb"
 * Output: "ab"
 *
 * Input: str = "aab"
 * Output: "a"
 * The two subssequence are 'a'(first) and 'a' (second). Note that 'b' cannot be considered as part of subsequence as
 * it would be at same index in both.
