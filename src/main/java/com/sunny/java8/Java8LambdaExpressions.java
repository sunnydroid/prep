 *
 * A Java Lambda expression is a function that can be created without belonging to a class.
 * They can be passed around as objects are and executed on demand.
 *
 * Java Lambda experessions can only be used when they are matched against a single method interface
 *
 * A single method interface is also referred to as a functional interface. Matching a Lambda expression
 * against an interface is divided into 3 steps
 * 1) Check the interface has only one method
 * 2) Do parameters of the Lambda expression match the method signature of the inteface
 * 3) Does the return type match the method signature
 *
